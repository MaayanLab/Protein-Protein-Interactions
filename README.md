# Protein-Protein-Interactions

The current repository holds the resulting network files cultivated from numerous online Protein-Protein-Interactions (PPI) datasets, as well as, a gene set library generated from the data (in the file labeled Output) and the Ipython Notebooks used to process the data (in the file labeled Scripts) .

The network files are seperated into individule networks based on species, as well as, an overall PPI network (where apporiate genes were mapped onto human genes using HomoloGene). 

All files are time-stamped with the last date the data was processed.
