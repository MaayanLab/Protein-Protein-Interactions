# Protein-Protein-Interactions

The current repository holds the resulting network files cultivated from numerous online Protein-Protein-Interactions (PPI) datasets, as well as, a gene set library generated from the data (in the file labeled Output) and the Ipython Notebooks used to process the data (in the file labeled Scripts) .

The network files are seperated into individule networks based on species, as well as, an overall PPI network. 

All files are timestamped with the last date the data was processed.
